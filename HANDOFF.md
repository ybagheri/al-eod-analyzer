# HANDOFF
_Last updated: 2026-10-12 by Muse Spark (opencode) — HEAD 7918099 + uncommitted Phase 2 (awaiting review)_

## 1. Project in one paragraph

al-eod-analyzer extracts Brooks-style structure from EOD review charts (ES M5
screenshots in `data/`), distils it into a playbook, and reproduces the reading with
a deterministic streaming engine (Python reference + later MQL5 port). Phase 0 builds
the skeleton only; no extraction, engine, or trading logic exists yet.

## 2. Current status

- Current phase: 2 — Taxonomy, label schema, glossary
- Phase status: in progress (implemented + gate green, awaiting user review before commit)
- Last green quality gate: 2026-10-12 pre-commit (ruff ✓ / format ✓ 39 files / mypy --strict ✓ 17 files / pytest 66 passed / coverage 95.1%)

## 3. What was done in this session

- Inventoried `data/`: 5 pilot images (`S&P500_Emini_M5_2022_07_29` … `2022_08_09`).
- Confirmed env: Python 3.14.8, no `git`, no `make`, no Tesseract, no API keys.
- Created skeleton: `pyproject.toml`, `src/brooks_lab/...`, `tests/test_smoke.py`,
  `tasks.py`, `Makefile`, configs, dotfiles, living docs, `mql5/` + `artifacts/` stubs.
- `docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md` already present and matching; kept as-is.
- Built `.venv`, installed package (`--no-deps`) + gate-relevant deps; fixed typer 0.27
  group `--version` (needs `invoke_without_command=True`) and ruff E501 in `tasks.py`.
- Gate GREEN 2026-10-11: ruff ✓, ruff format ✓ (18 files), mypy --strict ✓ (7 files),
  pytest 5 passed, coverage 100% (≥85 required).
- 2026-10-12: user installed Git 2.49.0; repo-local identity set from SSH-authenticated
  GitHub user (ybagheri / noreply email); remote switched to
  `git@github.com:ybagheri/al-eod-analyzer.git`; committed 4338faa (31 files, +1036)
  and pushed (new branch main → origin/main); images/venv confirmed excluded from index.
- Phase 1 implemented: domain `imaging` (ImageRecord/Manifest/StrEnum/parser) + `Clock`;
  infra `PillowProber` (sha256, sha1-id, PIL-only dHash), settings loader, axis hook;
  app `ImageIngestionService` (idempotent atomic manifest write) + stats;
  `brooks ingest` + `brooks manifest-stats` CLI; HTML contact sheet.
- Real run: 5/5 ok, all 1280x720 JPEG, dates 2022-07-29…2022-08-09, 7 missing dates
  (mostly weekends), 0 duplicates/corrupt/tiny; manifest + stats committed, sheet local.
- Fixes during Phase 1: pydantic `date`-field shadowing bug; typer-0.27 `--version`;
  ruff-0.17 rules (StrEnum, datetime.UTC, B008-ignore for typer idiom, RUF001);
  Pillow-12 `Resampling.BILINEAR` + `tobytes()` (getdata deprecated); added types-PyYAML.
- Phase 2 implemented: domain `labels` (DayLabel/EventLabel/ChartTime/ExtractionMeta,
  schema v1, unmapped→raw_label+review-queue invariant, migrate stub); frozen
  `config/taxonomy.yaml` v1 (14 day types, 38 events, synonyms); `Taxonomy` loader +
  normaliser; `build_review_queue` with normalised difflib suggestions;
  `brooks schema-export`; `docs/LABEL_SCHEMA.md` + `docs/GLOSSARY.md` draft (proposed
  numeric definitions, classes); ADR-004 (taxonomy freeze + PT axis time).
- Fixes during Phase 2: pydantic field/type name shadowing (same `date` lesson);
  normalise_wording moved to domain (layering); suggestions match normalised forms.

## 4. Decisions made (link to ADR numbers)

- ADR-001: tech stack (PEP 621, typer/pydantic, ruff/mypy/pytest, tasks.py gate) — see `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- ADR-004: taxonomy v1 frozen; Pacific axis time; unmapped→review-queue design.

## 5. Next actions (ordered, the very next step first)

1. USER: review Phase 2 report below; reply APPROVE to commit + push.
2. After approval: commit (`feat: Phase 2 taxonomy, label schema, and glossary`) + push, record hash.
3. Phase 3 starts ONLY on explicit user instruction.

## 6. Open questions / blockers

- None blocking. Push works via user's `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (tested OK as ybagheri).
- `make` absent on Windows → canonical gate is `python -m tasks check` (documented).
- No API keys, no Tesseract → fine for Phase 0; file-exchange mode planned for Phase 3.

## 7. Known issues / tech debt

- `config/taxonomy.yaml` is a draft stub (freezes in Phase 2) — low.
- `mql5/` contains stubs only — expected for Phase 0.
- Full `.[dev]` install incomplete: numpy/pandas/opencv-python/pytesseract/pre-commit
  NOT installed (12–44 MB wheels timed out on slow net); gate-relevant set + ruff/mypy
  installed. Fresh-clone install still declares them in `pyproject.toml` — medium.
- Gate MUST run with `.venv` on PATH (global mypy lacks typer) — documented in §9.

## 8. Data & artifact state

- Images in data/: 5 | Manifest entries: 5/5 (all ok)
- Labels extracted: 0/5 | Reviewed: 0 | Gold set: 0
- Market data coverage: none (Phase 5)
- Playbook version: none (Phase 8)

## 9. How to run / verify (copy-paste commands)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
brooks --version
python -m tasks check
brooks ingest
brooks manifest-stats
```

## 10. Metrics snapshot (real numbers only; "NOT RUN" if unknown)

- Extraction: NOT RUN
- Engine vs labels (dev/test): NOT RUN
- Parity Python↔MQL5: NOT RUN

## 11. Rules reminder for the next model

- Read README, ROADMAP, DECISIONS first. Do not skip phases. Update this file before each commit.
